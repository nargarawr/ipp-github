{\color{red} Mention previous work for client
My project was given to me by Matthew Pike, who works for a small start-up company in China. The project,
Niceway.to, has already had some work carried out on it, but it was not to the standard that my client was
happy with, and he would like for a complete rewrite of the software. The project aims to improve the
travelling experience of those that use the system, by offering them more visually appealing routes to travel
between locations. My client has stressed the importance of a social community around the application, this
means that the ability to express opinions on the content, as well as sharing it, is extremely important.

{\color{red} Over arching motivation - \textbf{what is being solved?}
a lot of people forget about the beauty in the world around them, and instead focus on getting to their destination as quickly as possible. This mentality promotes a culture of instant gratication, impatience, and self-involvement.
