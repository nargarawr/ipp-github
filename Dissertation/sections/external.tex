\section{External Aspect}
{\color{red}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Very similar to proposal
		\item as well as explicitly addresses how your project fulfilled (or not) its original intentions with regard to its `external aspect'.
		\item maybe put this section AFTER evaluation? (or just combine the two...?)
	\end{itemize}
