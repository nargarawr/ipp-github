	Successes and Limitations of the Project
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As a result of the test...
		\item + get proof that it is easy to use for morons, and claim this is a success (due to handling of errors and intuitive design)
		\item + modular design and adherence to design patterns with well commented code
		\item + 
		\item +0.5, I worked well and was always ahead
		\item - creation page was lacking in features
		\item - routing unreliable at times, because of using free service
		\item - lack of unit tests, especially considering zend and external devs
	\end{itemize}
