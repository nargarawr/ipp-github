\section{Introduction}
In recent years, the technologies behind satellite navigation and routing services have greatly advanced, allowing them to produce the quickest route between two points without spending more than a few seconds calculating it, even with technological limits \cite{lou2009map}. As a result, travelling via car is quicker and easier than ever before, and many drivers have now become focussed simply on reaching their destination as quickly as possible. This has resulted in a shift in the mindset of society where the scenery that we pass on the roads is simply a buffer between segments of our day, and it's beauty is left unappreciated. This mentality promotes a  culture of instant gratification, impatience, and self-involvement among the driving community, which has a huge detrimental affect on drivers, where any interruptions on their journey are cause for anger. In fact, it has been shown that since 1990, incidents of aggression during driving has risen 51\% \cite{vest1997road}. \ \\
\ \\
Some research has already been completed in an attempt to shift the focus of driving from simply travel, to also being an enjoyable recreational activity. This includes work such as automatically determining how ``nice'' a route is, using social network data \cite{peregrino2012mapping}\cite{van2011time} and how to personalise routes that have been deemed ``efficient'' \cite{chen2011discovering}. Outside of the world of research, many services already exist that provide users with a collection of scenic routes between two locations. The purpose of these services is to encourage drivers to enjoy driving more, and experience more of their surroundings. Examples of these include Google's ``My Maps''\cite{url2015gmaps}, MADMAPS\cite{url2015madmaps}, and MyScenicDrives\cite{url2015myscenicdrives}, which are discussed in further detail in section \ref{sec:existing-systems}.\ \\
\ \\
Unfortunately, these systems have some flaws that mean they do not wholly solve this problem, and therefore have not made a huge impact. The largest two being the method of delivery, and lack of user contribution (for MADMAPs and MyScenicDrives). These services are optimised for desktop browsing, and do not function well on mobile devices which, considering that in the UK 33\% of Internet users believe their smartphones to be the most important device for going online\cite{ofcom2015comms}, is a large portion of users lost. Alongside these major flaws, some other minor flaws are also present, including primitive search functionality, a small user base, slow and unresponsive webpages, and some services costing money.\ \\
\ \\
Niceway.to has three main aims: to build a community of travel enthusiasts, improve the travelling experience of those that use it, and allow for users of all skill groups to access it. It will provide a way for users to discover scenic and visually interesting routes between two locations, all of which have been provided by other members of the community. These routes will each contain a social commentary, with users being able to rate them, comment on them, and share them (these will be incentives for users to provide quality content, and to remain loyal to the site). To address the problem of previous software systems, mainly the method of delivery, it will be built as a fully-responsive web-application that functions equally well on desktop and mobile devices. \ \\
\ \\
As a final note, it is worth mentioning that this project will not focus on the classification of whether or not routes are ``nice'' or ``scenic''. Instead, the content will be entirely user driven, with the assumption that they would only contribute routes that are interesting and visually appealing. To further encourage this, a rating system for routes will be implement, so that ``better'' routes are more visible than those deemed less so.
