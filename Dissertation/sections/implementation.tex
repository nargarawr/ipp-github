\section{Software Implementation}
In this section, the actual implementation of the software has been detailed, including: what tools were used in the implementation, how the software was implemented, and any issues that were encountered during the implementation process.

\subsection{Key Implementation Decisions}
\label{sec:kid}
In this section, the tools used for the implementation for this project have been detailed, and the reason for their adoption has been justified. These justifications stem directly from the advantages and disadvantages discussed in section \ref{sec:pat}.

\subsubsection{Implementation Platform - Responsive Web Application}

can function both on desktop devices, and mobile devices by scaling the elements on display. \\
versatile because they run in a web browser, which means that they target all possible devices \\
back end can be whichever language the developers are most comfortable with, \\
easy to release updates, because they are instantaneous, and the users do not have to download \\
require constant internet connection - which is why the user has the ability to download stuff\\
more support / more personal experience\\

\subsubsection{Back End Tool - The Zend Framework (PHP)}

been around for a long time, and therefore has extensive documentation, \\
and well defined standards and guidelines. \\
fully object oriented framework, \\
huge number of convenience classes that are provided by default \\
bloated / slow, so I will specific remove core components I don't need\\

\subsubsection{Front End Tool - Twitter's Bootstrap}

	\textbf{why did I pick this? - shouldn't just be a repeat of section 3.1 ...}\\
fully responsive and scales easily and efficient to a multitude of devices, \\
huge amount of support online, \\
extensive documentation provided by Twitter themselves. \\
customised to only load the components that are required\\

\subsection{Implementation Methodology}
{\color{red}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item kanban - did with last diss and worked well, tips laid out by Henrik Kniberg \cite{kniberg2007scrum}
		\item meetings with max
		\item user stories - did with last diss and worked well
		\item gantt chart with max
		\item 	full example of taking a requirement, making story, splitting into sub tasks (in table or screenshot format)
		\item wrote down and expressed goals because its easier to reach if writtesn down \cite{wilson2008goal}. this is why, i would write down everything, including small bugs, so nothing was overlooked
	\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Problems Encountered}
{\color{red}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Problem:} No unit tests, new features meant bugs
		\item \textbf{What happened:} didn't have unit tests, so when adding new features others would break
		\item \textbf{What effect did this have:} lots of extra time spent debugging because i was unaware of bugs, and many demos not working because of bugs 
		\item \textbf{Why did it happen:} no unit tests, or proper debugging structure
		\item \textbf{What would I do differently/what I learned:} do unit tests, espec with zend
	\end{itemize}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Problem:} mapping service troubles
			\item \textbf{What happened:} I didn't spend time researching routing services, and just picked the first. 
			\item \textbf{What effect did this have:} when it came down to it, it didn't do what i needed it to do, this meant i had to reimplement functionality all over again - 
			\item \textbf{Why did it happen:}i rushed into things and didn't look at my options
			\item \textbf{What would I do differently/what I learned:} do your research!
		\end{itemize}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Problem:} didn't read spec
				\item \textbf{What happened:} got towards the end of the project and realised there were many features I had not included
				\item \textbf{What effect did this have:} meant I had to spend more time developing, when I thought I would be done
				\item \textbf{Why did it happen:} did't read the spec, I only looked at the major bullet points and glazed over the details because I was eager to get started
				\item \textbf{What would I do differently/what I learned:} read the spec very carefully
			\end{itemize}
