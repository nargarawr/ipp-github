 \section{Final Designs}
 After the initial designs were created, they were shared with the client for feedback. This section summarises that feedback, as well as displays the new designs which will be used when implementing the system. This includes one single design for each of the main pages, and updated designs for the generic pages.\ \\
 \ \\
 The client's main comment was ``we see social commentary being relegated to a minimal part of the UI, something we believe should be addressed as the social component is key to the success of the project. The revised designs should feature the social commentary more prominently and also aim to encourage users to contribute.''\ \\
 \ \\
 As a result of these comments, the main two alterations were made, were to add more prominent social commentary features on the route detail page, and to add an explanation of what the site does on the landing page.
 \newpage

\subsection{Landing Page}
For the landing page, I choose to use the minimalistic design. This, when coupled with the helpful popover explaining the features of the site, made it very accessible to new comers. They knew exactly what the purpose of the site was, and how to get started, and there were no unnecessary extras that would pose an obstacle for them.

\subsection{Route Listing Page}
The final route listing page is a modification of the map-less initial design. The main change is to the ``Search Again'' feature. Instead of having the search at the top of the page, before the results, it is now on the left hand side. The advantage of this is that the user's are presented with all the search results instantly, instead of having to look down the page to find them, which could confuse them. Having the search terms present on the page is useful so that the user can see any mistakes, or easily modify their current search results.

\newpage
\subsection{Route Detail Page}
The route detail page was the page that had the most changes between the initial and final designs. This was based off client feedback that the social interactions were not prominent enough. In light of this, the design was modified so that there were two columns: one for all the route details, and the other for only social commentary. This meant that the social aspect of the application was extremely prominent. The social stream was an amalgamation of all shares, comments, and fork that this route had received. The user will be able to filter this stream to only see content relevant to them. It also contains large social media share buttons, and a large comment box, with friendly prompts for the user to interact as well.

 	\vspace{-10mm}
 \end{figure}


\subsection{Route Creation Page}
The purpose of the route creation page was to allow to user to seamlessly interact with the map, and plan their route. This design has a small explanation in the top right, so the users know what to do, but other than that, there is very little between the user and the map. In fact, the only UI element on the page is a small box on the left hand side, which gives a list of the points the user has already entered, so that they can reorder them, and delete them.

 \newpage
 
 
\subsection{My Details Page}
The ``My Details'' page was one of the three ``My Account'' pages that the users could potentially access. On the right, there is a small navigation menu, which directs to the other pages, as well as containing a brief description about each of those pages.\ \\
\ \\
The page itself is very simple. It lists all of the user's information in text entry fields. This means that modifying the information is extremely simple and intuitive, and users would not be confused as to the purpose of this page.

		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/final/mydetails.png}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-6mm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{My Routes Page}
The ``My Routes'' page allowed users to see a list of all the routes that they had submitted. The could then do three things: edit the route (taking them to the route creation page), download the route, or delete the route (after asking if they were sure).\ \\
\ \\
Users also have the ability to add new routes from this page, which means this page can be considered the hub of all route activity.

\newpage 

\subsection{Admin Page}
The admin page is only available to users that have been marked as the administrators of the application, which will stop regular users accessing these tools, and potentially causing harm to the application or its users. The page itself is used for the management and maintenance of the application. All the different tools are in separate panels, allowing the admins to clearly identify which tool they need to use, and allowing them to focus only on that part of the page. It features the ability to manage users, create users, post announcements, and manage the server, all from this control panel.

\end{figure} 

\subsection{Login Page}
The login page didn't change much between the initial and final designs, as it is a relatively simple page. The main change is moving the login, and signup buttons to separate lines and adding the ``or'' text. Originally they were both on one line, so it was less obvious which button needed to be pressed at a glance. With them on separate lines, the user would naturally look at the top button first - allowing them to login, which was the purpose of the page. If they didn't wish to log in, they would continue looking, and would identify the sign up button, which they could then click.

	\vspace{-6mm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Signup Page}
The final page was the signup page which, like the log in page, is very simple, and didn't require many changes between the initial version and the final version. The main difference was highlighting which fields were not required (by adding the optional text to them)m and allowing users to specify their passwords (which was not present on the initial designs by mistake).
